# Toolkit Overview

Welcome to the Spoon Toolkit catalog. Everything here is a ready-to-use agent helper that ships with the SpoonOS runtime. The toolkit is organized by domain so you can jump straight to the integrations you need:

- **Crypto** – Market data, EVM utilities, Neo RPC helpers, Chainbase-powered analytics, and more. Use these when your agent needs to trade, monitor, or analyze on-chain activity.
- **Data Platforms** – Providers such as Chainbase, Thirdweb, and Desearch for structured blockchain data without writing bespoke HTTP clients.
- **GitHub Intelligence** – Repository scanners and provider hooks that summarize repos, issues, and activity.
- **Social Media** – Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and Email helpers for outreach and notification workflows.
- **Storage** – Off-chain storage bridges (AIOZ, Oort, Foureverland) so agents can archive artifacts or publish outputs.

Navigate the sidebar on the left to dive into any module. Each page documents the environment variables, key classes, and concrete usage snippets for that toolkit.
