# Agents

Agents are the core intelligence layer of SpoonOS, providing reasoning, planning, and action execution capabilities.

## What are Agents?

An agent is an AI system that can:

- **Reason** about problems and goals
- **Plan** sequences of actions to achieve objectives
- **Execute** actions using available tools
- **Learn** from feedback and adapt behavior

## Agent Types

### ReAct Agents

ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agents follow a thought-action-observation loop:

```python
from spoon_ai.agents import SpoonReactAI
from spoon_ai.chat import ChatBot

# Create a ReAct agent
agent = SpoonReactAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model_name="gpt-4.1", llm_provider="openai")
)

# Run the agent
response = await agent.run("Get the current Bitcoin price")
```

**Advantages:**

- Simple and intuitive reasoning process
- Good for straightforward tasks
- Lower computational overhead

**Best for:**

- Single-step tasks
- Direct API calls
- Simple automation

### Graph Agents

Graph agents use structured workflows with nodes and edges:

```python
from spoon_ai.agents import GraphAgent
from spoon_ai.graph import create_graph

# Create a graph workflow
graph = create_graph()
agent = GraphAgent(graph=graph)

# Execute complex workflow
result = await agent.execute("Analyze market trends and execute trades")
```

**Advantages:**

- Complex multi-step workflows
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Better error handling and recovery

**Best for:**

- Multi-step processes
- Conditional logic
- Parallel operations

## Agent Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LLM Provider** - The language model powering the agent
2. **Tool Manager** - Manages available tools and execution
3. **Memory System** - Stores conversation history and context
4. **Prompt System** - Handles system prompts and instructions

### Agent Lifecycle

    D --> E[Select Action]
    E --> F[Execute Tool]
    F --> G[Observe Result]
    G --> H{Task Complete?}
    H -->|No| D
    H -->|Yes| I[Return Response]
```

## Creating Custom Agents

### Basic Agent Setup

```python
from spoon_ai.agents.base import BaseAgent
from spoon_ai.tools import ToolManager

class CustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, llm, tools=None):
        super().__init__(llm)
        self.tool_manager = ToolManager(tools or [])

    async def run(self, message: str) -> str:
        # Custom agent logic here
        return await self.process_message(message)
```

### Agent Configuration

```python
# Configure agent with specific tools
from spoon_ai.tools.crypto_tools import CryptoTools
from spoon_ai.tools.web3_tools import Web3Tools

agent = SpoonReactAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model_name="gpt-4.1", llm_provider="openai"),
    tools=[CryptoTools(), Web3Tools()]
)
```

## Best Practices

### Tool Selection
- Choose tools that match your use case
- Avoid tool overload - too many tools can confuse the agent
- Test tool combinations thoroughly

### Prompt Engineering
- Provide clear, specific instructions
- Include examples of desired behavior
- Set appropriate constraints and guidelines

### Error Handling

- Leverage framework's automatic retry mechanisms
- Use built-in fallback strategies
- Rely on framework's structured error handling

### Framework Error Handling

SpoonOS agents benefit from built-in error resilience:

```python
# Framework handles errors automatically
agent = SpoonReactAI(
    llm=ChatBot(model_name="gpt-4.1", llm_provider="openai"),
    tools=[CryptoTools(), Web3Tools()]
)

# Automatic handling includes:
# - LLM provider failures with fallback
# - Tool execution errors with retry
# - Network issues with graceful degradation
response = await agent.run("Get Bitcoin price and analyze trends")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- ReAct agents: Lower memory footprint
- Graph agents: Higher memory for complex workflows

### Execution Speed
- Simple tasks: ReAct agents are faster
- Complex workflows: Graph agents are more efficient

### Scalability
- ReAct: Better for high-frequency, simple tasks
- Graph: Better for complex, long-running processes
